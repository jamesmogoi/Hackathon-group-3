👥 Suggested Team Roles & Tech Stack
1. Frontend Developer (Web/UI)

Stack: React / Next.js + TailwindCSS

Role:

Build the student/parent/teacher dashboards

Implement transport tracking maps, quiz UI, and transparency charts

Make the demo beautiful and functional

2. Backend Developer (APIs & Data)

Stack: Django REST Framework or Node.js (Express)

Role:

Create APIs for authentication, transport logs, and analytics

Manage databases (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

Secure endpoints (JWT, OAuth2)

3. AI / Data Engineer (Smart Features)

Stack: Python + TensorFlow / PyTorch / scikit-learn

Role:

Build the AI-powered revision tool (adaptive quizzes, recommendations)

Prototype dropout risk prediction model (if time allows)

Provide analytics for educators

4. Mobile Developer (Optional)

Stack: React Native / Flutter

Role:

Build parent-facing app (transport tracking, notifications)

Add push notifications (safety updates, quiz reminders)

5. DevOps / Infra (Optional but Elite)

Stack: Docker + GitHub Actions + Vercel (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend)

Role:

Set up CI/CD (auto-deploy to cloud on push)

Ensure demo never breaks during presentation

6. Pitch & Storytelling Lead

Not just coding — one team member should focus on:

Crafting the narrative (why this matters, emotional hook)

Designing the pitch deck & live demo flow

Making sure judges feel the impact

  👥 Team Roles Breakdown
🖌️ Frontend Dev #1 (UI/UX Specialist)

Owns the student & parent dashboard

Builds Transport Safety Map (GPS mock) → shows bus tracking + notifications

Implements charts for finance transparency (using recharts or chart.js)

Makes everything clean, responsive, hackathon-polished

🖼️ Frontend Dev #2 (Interactive Learning)

Owns the AI Revision Tool UI → quiz interface, gamification, results view

Integrates API calls to backend (student progress, AI recommendations)

Handles mentor/peer chat mockup (could be a simple messaging page)

Works closely with Data Scientist to display personalized results

⚙️ Backend Dev (APIs + Auth)

Builds REST APIs for:

User authentication (JWT login/signup)

Transport events (bus location, status)

Quiz data (questions, results)

Finance dashboard (fetching mock data)

Manages database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)

Deploys backend (Heroku / Render / Railway for speed)

🧠 Data Scientist (AI/Analytics)

Develops Personalized Revision Engine:

Adaptive quizzes (recommend next question based on past answers)

Simple ML model (logistic regression, decision trees, or TensorFlow lite model)

(Optional stretch goal) Dropout Risk Predictor using mock student data

Provides teacher analytics dashboard data (charts, heatmaps, risk levels)

Works with backend to expose models as an API endpoint

⚡ Suggested Tech Stack (Fast Hackathon-Friendly)

Frontend: React (Next.js optional), TailwindCSS, Recharts/Chart.js, Mapbox/Leaflet for transport tracking

Backend: Django REST Framework (Python = good synergy with Data Scientist)

Database: PostgreSQL (relational) or MongoDB (if you want faster setup)

AI/DS: Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow Lite if time allows)

Deployment:

Frontend → Vercel (1-click deploy)

Backend → Render/Heroku/Railway

DB → Free hosted PostgreSQL (Supabase, Railway, ElephantSQL)

🏆 Demo Strategy (How You’ll Impress Judges)

Parent opens app → sees bus location + notification (“Your child has arrived at school”)

Student logs in → takes adaptive quiz → gets personalized feedback

Teacher dashboard → sees transparency charts + at-risk students

Wrap up with narrative: “EduSphere ensures safety, empowers learning, and builds trust in education.”
